# Moonbeam GLMR Bridge Whale Exit

Tracks when someone moves **500 000+ GLMR** through the official Moonbeam → Ethereum bridge in a single transaction.

This is not a swap.  
This is **real capital flight** from the Polkadot ecosystem back to Ethereum L1.

## Run

```bash
python moonbeam_glmr_whale_bridge.py
